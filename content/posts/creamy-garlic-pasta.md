### Method

1. Prepare the ingredients by grating the Parmigiano Reggiano, roughly chopping the parsley, and mincing the garlic.
1. In a large preheated pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter and fry the garlic until golden brown and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
1. Add the milk and chicken stock to the pan.
1. Add the pasta to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the pasta is cooked al dente, stirring occasionally. The cooking time will depend on the type of pasta used (about 15 minutes for tagliatelle).
1. If the liquid level is getting low and the pasta isn’t yet cooked, add some more water. Don’t add too much, or the pasta might become overcooked while the sauce thickens.
1. Once the pasta is cooked, add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and chopped parsley (reserve a little for garnishing). Stir to combine.
1. If the sauce is still too watery, turn up the heat to cook it down quickly to your desired consistency.
1. Serve the pasta in bowls and garnish with reserved Parmigiano Reggiano and parsley.


### Notes:

- If you prefer a milder garlic flavor, use fewer cloves.
- Adjust the consistency of the sauce by adding more or less liquid as needed.
