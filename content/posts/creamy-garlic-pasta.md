review: "Super nice, super easy, garlicky taste was strong. Could maybe do with more pasta next time since it was quite saucy. Maybe 1.5x sauce ingredients 2x pasta. Also, fettuccine maybe better?"

### Method

1. Prepare the ingredients by grating the Parmigiano Reggiano, roughly chopping the parsley, and mincing the garlic.
1. In a large preheated pan over medium-high heat, melt the butter and fry the garlic until golden brown and fragrant, about 1-2 minutes.
1. Add the milk and chicken stock to the pan.
1. Add the pasta to the pan and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer until the pasta is cooked al dente, stirring occasionally. The cooking time will depend on the type of pasta used (about 15 minutes for tagliatelle).
1. If the liquid level is getting low and the pasta isn’t yet cooked, add some more water. Don’t add too much, or the pasta might become overcooked while the sauce thickens.
1. Once the pasta is cooked, add the grated Parmigiano Reggiano and chopped parsley (reserve a little for garnishing). Stir to combine.
1. If the sauce is still too watery, turn up the heat to cook it down quickly to your desired consistency.
1. Serve the pasta in bowls and garnish with reserved Parmigiano Reggiano and parsley.


1. Preheat pan to roughly 7/10, melt butter & fry garlic for a minute or two until golden brown & fragrant
1. Add milk and chicken stock
1. Add pasta to pan
1. Bring pan to a boil on 8/10, then reduce to a simmer (5/10)
1. Let pasta cook until al dente
     - How long this takes really depends on the pasta you're using, it took about 15 mins with tagliatelle
     - Make sure that the tagliatelle is actually being cooked fully. If it's partially uncovered by the liquid it'll need to be stirred a few times.
     - If the liquid level is getting low and the pasta isn't yet cooked then add some more water. Don't add too much otherwise you might end up overcooking the pasta while bring the sauce to the right consistency
1. Once pasta is correct firmness, add the cheese and parsley, save a little of each for garnishing
1. If sauce is still too watery, turn the heat up to cook it down to correct consistency quickly
1. Serve in bowl and garnish with parsley & parmigiano

### Notes:

- If you prefer a milder garlic flavor, use fewer cloves.
- Adjust the consistency of the sauce by adding more or less liquid as needed.
