### Method

1. Preheat pan to roughly 7/10, melt butter & fry garlic for a minute or two until golden brown & fragrant
1. Add milk and chicken stock
1. Add pasta to pan
1. Bring pan to a boil on 8/10, then reduce to a simmer (5/10)
1. Let pasta cook until al dente
1. Once pasta is correct firmness, add the cheese and parsley, save a little of each for garnishing
1. If sauce is still too watery, turn the heat up to cook it down to correct consistency quickly
1. Serve in bowl and garnish with parsley & parmigiano

### Notes:

- If you prefer a milder garlic flavor, use fewer cloves.
- Adjust the consistency of the sauce by adding more or less liquid as needed.
- Could maybe do with more pasta next time since it was quite saucy. Maybe 1.5x sauce and 2x pasta. 
- Fettuccine/Pappardelle maybe better?
