review: "The effort:reward ratio for this is probably the best of any pasta I've made. Difficult to mess up and super cheap. This recipe calls for 5-6 cloves of garlic which made it very strong, use less if you don't like a strong garlicky taste"

### Prep

- Grate parmigiano
- Roughly cut up the parsley, as fine as desired
- Mince Garlic
- Make Chicken Stock if using cubes (2 per 500ml)

### Method

1. Preheat pan to roughly 7/10, melt butter & fry garlic for a minute or two until golden brown & fragrant
1. Add milk and chicken stock
1. Add pasta to pan
1. Bring pan to a boil on 8/10, then reduce to a simmer (5/10)
1. Let pasta cook until al dente
     - How long this takes really depends on the pasta you're using, it took about 15 mins with tagliatelle
     - Make sure that the tagliatelle is actually being cooked fully. If it's partially uncovered by the liquid it'll need to be stirred a few times.
     - If the liquid level is getting low and the pasta isn't yet cooked then add some more water. Don't add too much otherwise you might end up overcooking the pasta while bring the sauce to the right consistency
1. Once pasta is correct firmness, add the cheese and parsley, save a little of each for garnishing
1. If sauce is still too watery, turn the heat up to cook it down quickly, it's up to you how thick you want it
1. Serve in bowl and garnish with parsley & parmigiano
